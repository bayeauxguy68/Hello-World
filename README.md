# Hello-World
A place to store ideas and things I am interested in learning more abouit

I have moments of great creativity followed by longer moments of agonizingly mundane boredom. 
As of the time I am writing this edit, I am under a doctors care.
I had cervical fusion surgery on my neck and am trying to not lose my sanity until I can return to work.
